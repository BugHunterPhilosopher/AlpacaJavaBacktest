# Alpaca Java Backtest
Alpaca Java Backtest is a simple and fast stock trading algorithm backtesting library. It uses [Polygon](https://polygon.io/) for historic quotes, trades, aggregates, and other equity data points.
You should have a live trading account with [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets) in order to get a free API key for Polygon to use this backtester.
This Library uses [alpaca-java](https://github.com/mainstringargs/alpaca-java) exclusively as it contains a PolygonAPI and useful POJO classes.
